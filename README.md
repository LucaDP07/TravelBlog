**Strategy**

For the development of the website the Agile methodology was taken using GitHub functions which are issues, milestones, iterations and Kanban board.

1.Milestones were used to create Epics with a custom template.
2.Issues were used to create User Stories with a custom template. Eash user story has been mapped out using the Kanban board format. Each one has acceptance criteria and tasks.
Each user story was linked to an Epic.

**FEATURES**
- - -

 - Navigation menu
 
 The navigation menu is clear and consistent throughout the site to provide the users an easy navigation. Links to Home, Add a trip, Register and Sign In/Out are available. If the user is not signed in the Sign in and Register links are visible in the navbar. If the user is signed in the Sign In and Register links are replaced by a Log Out link and the Add a trip page link is visible. While the Logo will be always displayed in any screen, the other links that the user can find in the bar, will switch to hamburger on tablets and mobiles.

 - Add a trip form
 
 When the users are logged in, they can see on the navigation bar the option "Add a trip". Simply by clicking on it the form opens where the user can enter all the fields to add a post and create a new content.

 - The Current Score Area
 
 Under the Start Button, the user can see the Current Score Area, which will be visible only in the Game Area. The score gets updated everytime the player clicks on the right or wrong flag. In this way the user has the chance to keep track of his/her performance.

 - The Score Area and the Timer

 Under the Board Game, the user can find a timer of 20 seconds which will help to keep track of the time left to complete the game. Also, under the timer, the player can find the resume of the games won and lost. The colors choosen for it are green and orange as a connection to the irish flag.

  - The Final Score Message

 Once the 20 seconds are over the Game Board will display the final score which will replace the flags.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**
- - -

- HTML: HTML has been used to give structure and content to the website.
- CSS: In order to style the content created with HTML, the CSS language has been used.
- Google Fonts: I used the Kanit and sans-serif font.
- Font Awesome: I used ther Font Awesome icons for the logo of the game located at the left of the heading.
- Pixabay: I used this platform for the images of the flags.
- Balsamiq Wireframes: I used it to produce low fidelity wireframes to organise the structure of the pages.


**TESTING**
- - - 

All the pages of the website have ben tested using the developer tools in Google Chrome. The code had to be changed along the process in order to achieve the responsiveness required for the project. The preview from Gitpod helped to constantly check all the changes made.

Testing was performed using a MacBook Air (M1, 2020) on macOS Monterey with the following browsers:
- Google Chrome 102.0.5005.61
- Safari 15.3
- Mozilla Firefox 101.0.1

After testing the website I can confirm the project it's responsive in its all pages and works properly on all standard screen sizes.

The "Play" button is working in each section of the project. 
- In the Home Page the button starts the game. 
- In the Board Game/Game Area the button reset the score and starts a new game.


- BUGS

While on GitPod I was able to see the flags flashing in the Board Game, after the deployment, the live site was not showing the same results as on GitPod. Since I was refencing my images from my css file, I had to tell the server to come out of the css folder. Sorted fixing the path.
